# Personal Portfolio 2020

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/7ec1dd00-30a0-4187-8a5b-3453a22e544f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/daanvanderzwaag/deploys)

To highlight personal works from the past years, I’ve created a dynamic website to showcase projects. Next to displaying work, this project taught me more about Gatsby.js, React.js, Serverless Deployments and Continuous Integrations.

## Use this project

Personally, I’ve learnt the most by recreating beautiful digital experiences made by others. That’s why you can use this repo to play around and to learn about the used tools.

-   [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) Javascript framework for building the User Interface (UI)
-   [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) Static Site Generator (SSR) for speed optimisation
-   [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) API based CMS for managing the content
-   [OGL](https://github.com/oframe/ogl) Library for WebGL interactions
-   [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) Javascript animation library for the UI

## Personal data

Be aware, since the data is pulled from a personal Contentful setup, you’ll need to create an own data flow to access the complete project. Without access to our Contentful API key, the project will fail running.

> 👀 Please send me a message if you would like to have acces to our data for example practises.
